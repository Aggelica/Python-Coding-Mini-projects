Paper-Scissors-Rock Game
This is a simple command-line game called "Paper-Scissors-Rock". The user can play against the computer by choosing between three options: Paper (P), Scissors (S), or Rock (R). 
The computer's choice is determined by a pre-defined sequence of letters.

Instructions
Run the code to start the game.
The program will prompt you to enter your choice: 'P' for Paper, 'S' for Scissors, 'R' for Rock, or press the "ENTER" key to exit the game.
If you enter an invalid choice (other than 'P', 'S', or 'R'), the program will display an error message and ask you to pick again.
After you make a valid choice, the program will compare your choice with the computer's choice.

The game will follow these rules to determine the winner:
Paper beats Rock
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
If both choices are the same, it's a draw.

The program will display the computer's choice and the result of the round.
At the end of each round, you will be asked to press any key to play again or press the "ENTER" key to exit the game.
If you choose to play again, the game will start over from the beginning.
If you press the "ENTER" key at any time during the game, the program will end, and the game will be terminated.

Have fun playing the Paper-Scissors-Rock game!
